The measurement of the \CP parameters \SJpsiKS and \CJpsiKS presented in this
thesis was realised on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$\SI{3.0}{\per\femto\barn}$ recorded by the \LHCb experiment in
\acl{protonproton} collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\num{7}$ and
$\SI{8}{\TeV}$. The sample contains $\num{41500}$ reconstructed $\BdToJpsiKS$
candidates with a flavour tagging decision assigned by either the combination of
the \acl{OS} tagging algorithms or by the \acl{SSpi} tagging algorithm. Using an
\acl{uEML} fit the \CP parameters \SJpsiKS and \CJpsiKS are measured to be
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \SJpsiKS &= \phantom{-}\num{0.731} \pm \num{0.035} \statp \pm \num{0.020} \systp \eqcm\eqand \\
    \CJpsiKS &=           \num{-0.038} \pm \num{0.032} \statp \pm \num{0.005} \systp \eqcm
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
with a statistical correlation coefficient of $\rho(\SJpsiKS,\CJpsiKS) =
\num{0.483}$. With the parameter \CJpsiKS fixed to zero the measurement yields
$\SJpsiKS = \sintwobeta = \num{0.746 +- 0.030}\statp$.

The measurement improves the previous \LHCb result \cite{Aaij:1497268} by
including a larger dataset, additional trigger lines, an optimised candidate
selection and by incorporating the \SSpi tagger decisions. It is by now the most
precise measurement of \CP violation at a hadron collider and is in excellent
agreement with the current world average. \Cref{fig:conclusion:ckm_fitter_15}
shows the ${(\dquark,\bquark)}$ unitarity triangle in the
${(\ovE{\rho},\ovE{\eta})}$-plane from a global fit incorporating all measured
\CKM parameters \cite{Charles:2004jd} except from the ones reported here that is
additionally shown to allow for a better comparison.

During \RunTwo of the \LHC, starting this year at a centre-of-mass energy of
$\sqrt{s} = \SI{13}{\TeV}$, \LHCb is expected to collect a large dataset
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of around $\SI{5}{\per\femtobarn}$
until the next long shut-down coming in 2018. With an estimated sensitivity on
\SJpsiKS of $\num{0.018}$ \cite{Moedden:2015}, this additional data will allow
the \LHCb collaboration to perform the world's single best measurement of
\sintwobeta. As this sensitivity falls below the current systematic uncertainty
an emphasis has to be laid to a in particular better understanding of the
background tagging asymmetry and to reduce the uncertainties on the flavour
tagging calibration parameters.

To further improve the sensitivity on the measurement of \sintwobeta, additional
decay modes will be explored. The decay of the \Bd into the $\Jpsi (\to\elel)
\KS$ final state will contribute with a sensitivity of $\num{000}$ \cite{Ramon}.
Also higher charmonium resonances as in $\BdToPsiTwoSKS$ will add sensitivity to
the combined result. Preparatory studies have shown an expected sensitivity on
\sintwobeta of $\num{0.09}$ in the combination of the $\psitwos\to\Jpsi\pi\pi$
and the $\psitwos\to\mumu$ final states \cite{Mueller:2014}.

% next steps: additional charmonium channels: Jpsi to e+e-, psi(2S)

The biggest competitor will be the \BelleTwo experiment. The collaboration plans
to start data taking in 2018 with an expected instantaneous luminosity
$\num{50}$ times larger than its precursor. With an assumption of $\num{100}$
days of efficient data taking per year, an integrated luminosity of
$\SI{9}{\per\attobarn}$ will be recorded per year. If these expectations hold
\BelleTwo will be able to reduce the total uncertainty on \sintwobeta to
$\num{0.010}$, being mainly dominated by irreducible systematic uncertainties
\cite{Aushev:2010bq}.
