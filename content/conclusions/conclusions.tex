The measurement of the \CP parameters \SJpsiKS and \CJpsiKS presented in this
thesis was realised on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$\SI{3.0}{\per\femto\barn}$ recorded by the \LHCb experiment in
\acl{protonproton} collisions at centre-of-mass energies of $\num{7}$ and
$\SI{8}{\TeV}$. The sample contains $\num{41500}$ reconstructed $\BdToJpsiKS$
candidates with a flavour tagging decision assigned by either the combination of
the \acl{OS} tagging algorithms or by the \acl{SSpi} tagging algorithm. Using an
\acl{uEML} fit the \CP parameters \SJpsiKS and \CJpsiKS are measured to be
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \SJpsiKS &= \phantom{-}\num{0.731} \pm \num{0.035} \statp \pm \num{0.020} \systp \eqcm\eqand \\
    \CJpsiKS &=           \num{-0.038} \pm \num{0.032} \statp \pm \num{0.005} \systp \eqcm
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
with a statistical correlation coefficient of $\rho(\SJpsiKS,\CJpsiKS) =
\num{0.483}$. With the parameter \CJpsiKS fixed to zero the measurement yields
$\SJpsiKS = \sintwobeta = \num{0.746 +- 0.030}\statp$.

The measurement improves the previous \LHCb result \cite{Aaij:1497268} by
including a larger dataset, additional trigger lines, an optimised candidate
selection and by incorporating the \SSpi tagger decisions. It is by now the most
precise measurement of \CP violation at a hadron collider and is in excellent
agreement with the current world average. \Cref{fig:conclusion:ckm_fitter_15}
shows the ${(\dquark,\bquark)}$ unitarity triangle in the
${(\ovE{\rho},\ovE{\eta})}$-plane from a global fit incorporating all measured
\CKM parameters \cite{Charles:2004jd} except from the one reported here that is
additionally shown to allow for a better comparison.
