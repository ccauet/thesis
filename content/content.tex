  \item muon PID efficiency
  \item lectron PID: balance of track momentum and energy of the charged cluster in the ECAL matched with extrapolated tracks; matching bremsstrahlung photons to electron tracks before the magnet

\section{Trigger}
two level trigger system: L0 and HLT, L0 from custom made electronics, real-time with bunch crossing-frequency, HLT on software in processor farm
\subsection{L0 trigger}
from 40MHz to 1MHz, trigger on large transverse momentum pT and energy ET; the hightest ET hadron, electron, photon clusters in the calo; the two highest pT muons in the muon chambers; pile-up system in velo calculates the number of PVs; the caos calculate the total observed energy and estimate the number of tracks based on the number of hits in the SPD; using these global event cuts to reject events which would otherwise be triggered due to large combinatorics
\subsection{High level trigger}
reduced the 1MHz L0 output rate to 5kHz; software based and flexible, again composed of two parts: HLT1 and HLT2;
