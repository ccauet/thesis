\label{sec:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks}

The decay mode \BdToJpsiKS is well known [] as the gold-plated channel to measure
\CP violation in \Bd decays. With negligible contributions from \DCS
modes [], a $\ovE{\bquark}\to\ovE{\cquark}\cquark\ovE{\squark}$ transition
dominated by a single weak phase [], and an easy to reconstruct final state the
analysis of \BdToJpsiKS decays is a unique way to test the \SM quark flavour
sector.

The decay is characterized by a $\Bd$ or $\Bdbar$ meson decaying into an
intermediate $\Jpsi$ and $\Kz$ meson. To take advantage of the superior
detection efficiency of charged particles the subsequent $\JpsiToMuMu$ decay
mode is chosen, as well as the decay of the $\Kz$ into two oppositely charged
pions. The decay $\KzToPiPi$ is mediated by the mass eigenstates $\KS$ and $\KL$
of the neutral kaon. Besides second-order effects discussed in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:cpv_measurement:kaon_regeneration}, the \CP
violating decay of the long lived eigenstate $\KL$ into two pions is neglected.
Thus, the two pion final state used in this analysis with an invariant mass that
matches the $\Kz$ mass, is denoted as a $\KS$. 

The $\mumu\pipi$ final state is common to both initial \Bmesons, hence can be
reached either directly or after mixing of the \Bmeson states and the decay time
dependent \CP asymmetry \CPAsymmetry can be defined using
\cref{eq:cpv_theory:flavour_physics:time_evolution:differential_decay_rates} as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks:cp_asymmetry}
  \begin{split}
    \CPAsymmetry &\equiv 
      \frac{\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) - \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)}
           {\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) + \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)} \\
                 &= \frac{\SJpsiKS\sin(\DMd t) - \CJpsiKS\cos(\DMd t)}{\cosh\bigl(\frac{\DG t}{2}\bigr) + \DJpsiKS\sinh\bigl(\frac{\DG t}{2}\bigr)}
  \end{split}
