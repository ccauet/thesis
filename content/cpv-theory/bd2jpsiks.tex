\label{sec:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks}

The decay mode \BdToJpsiKS is well known as the gold-plated channel to measure
\CP violation in \Bd decays. With negligible contributions from \DCS modes, a
$\ovE{\bquark}\to\ovE{\cquark}\cquark\ovE{\squark}$ transition dominated by a
single weak phase, and an easy to reconstruct final state the analysis of
\BdToJpsiKS decays is a unique way to test the \SM quark flavour sector
\cite{Bevan:2014iga}.

The decay is characterized by a $\Bd$ or $\Bdbar$ meson decaying into
intermediate $\Jpsi$ and $\Kz$ mesons. To take advantage of the superior
detection efficiency for charged particles the subsequent $\JpsiToMuMu$ decay
mode is chosen, as well as the decay of the $\Kz$ into two oppositely charged
pions. The decay $\KzToPiPi$ is mediated by the mass eigenstates $\KS$ and $\KL$
of the neutral kaon. Besides second-order effects discussed in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:cpv_measurement:kaon_regeneration}, the \CP
violating decay of the long lived eigenstate $\KL$ into two pions is neglected.
Thus, the two pion final state used in this analysis with an invariant mass that
matches the $\Kz$ mass is denoted as a $\KS$.
\Cref{fig:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks:feynman_bdtojpsiks} illustrates the Feynman
diagrams of the decays of \Bd and \Bdbar into the \Jpsi\KS final state.

The $\mumu\pipi$ final state is common to both initial \Bmesons, hence can be
reached either directly or after mixing of the \Bmeson states and the decay time
dependent \CP asymmetry ,$\CPAsymmetry(\obsTime)$, can be defined using
\cref{eq:cpv_theory:flavour_physics:time_evolution:differential_decay_rates} as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks:cp_asymmetry}
  \begin{split}
    \CPAsymmetry(\obsTime) &\equiv 
      \frac{\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) - \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)}
           {\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) + \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)} \\
                 &= \frac{\SJpsiKS\sin(\DMd t) - \CJpsiKS\cos(\DMd t)}{\cosh\bigl(\frac{\DG t}{2}\bigr) + \DJpsiKS\sinh\bigl(\frac{\DG t}{2}\bigr)} \eqcm
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Bd$ and $\Bdbar$ denote the meson production flavour at $t=0$.

Considering the vanishing decay width difference of the two mass eigenstates,
$\DGd/\Gd = \num{0.001 +- 0.010}$ \cite{Amhis:2014hma}, the \CP asymmetry
further simplifies to
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks:cp_asymmetry:simplified}
  \CPAsymmetry(\obsTime) = \SJpsiKS\sin(\DMd t) - \CJpsiKS\cos(\DMd t) \eqpd
\end{equation}
%
The \CP coefficients introduced in
\cref{eq:cpv_theory:flavour_physics:time_evolution:cp_coefficients} can be
approximated to a high precision to be
%
\begin{equation}
  \CJpsiKS = 0           \eqcm\eqand 
  \SJpsiKS = \sintwobeta \eqcm
\end{equation}
%
as direct \CP violation is expected to be small
$\vert\ovE{A}_{\Jpsi\KS}/A_{\Jpsi\KS}\vert\approx 1$, and \CP violation in
mixing is experimentally excluded $\vert q/p \vert = 1$. Thus, eventually the
\CP asymmetry reduces to
%
\begin{equation}
  \CPAsymmetry(\obsTime) = \sintwobeta\sin(\DMd t) \eqcm
\end{equation}
%
with $\DMd = \SI{0.510}{\planckbar\per\ps}$ \cite{Agashe:2014kda}.

The current world average, \cite{Amhis:2014hma}
%
\begin{equation*}
  \sintwobeta = \num{0.679 +- 0.020} \eqcm
\end{equation*}
%
is dominated by measurements by \Babar and \Belle in the \BdToJpsiKS channel
where both the $\elel$ and $\mumu$ final states of the $\Jpsi$ as well as the
$\pipi$ and $\piz\piz$ final states of the $\KS$ are studied. The \Belle
collaboration \cite{Adachi:2012et} reports
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \SJpsiKS^{\text{\Belle}} &= 0.670 \pm 0.029 \statp \pm 0.013 \systp              \eqcm\eqand \\
    \CJpsiKS^{\text{\Belle}} &= 0.015 \pm 0.021 \statp \pm {}_{0.045}^{0.023} \systp \eqcm
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
while the \Babar measurement \cite{Aubert:2009aw} yields
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \SJpsiKS^{\text{\Babar}} &= 0.657 \pm 0.036 \statp \pm 0.012 \systp \eqcm\eqand \\
    \CJpsiKS^{\text{\Babar}} &= 0.026 \pm 0.025 \statp \pm 0.016 \systp \eqpd
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
A first measurement of $\sintwobeta$ was performed by the \acs*{LHCb}
collaboration using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$\SI{1}{\per\femtobarn}$ collected during \RunOne in 2011. The analysis
comprised $\num{8000}$ flavour-tagged \BdToJpsiKS candidates, reconstructed in
the $\mumu\pipi$ final state. The reported results \cite{Aaij:1497268} are
%
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
    \SJpsiKS &= 0.73 \pm 0.07 \statp \pm 0.04 \systp \eqcm\eqand \\
    \CJpsiKS &= 0.03 \pm 0.09 \statp \pm 0.01 \systp \eqpd
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
Beside the direct measurement, the value of $\sintwobeta$ can be estimated by a
global fit to the \CKM parameter space. As this fit can be performed with and
without considering the respective parameters, a $\chisq$ pull can be computed
for each quantity. For $\sintwobeta$ a small tension of $\Delta\chisq =
\num{1.74}$ is observed, that can be interpreted as higher-order contributions
not accounted for or the influence of potential \BSM effects.
