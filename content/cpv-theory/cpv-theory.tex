\section{Oscillations of neutral B mesons}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Difference between mass and weak eigenstates, Wiger-Weisskopf approximation, mass difference, decay-time width difference, behaviour under C/P transformations, quark mixing phase definitions.
  \item Definition of states for the B0 system (and maybe the K system), 
  \item Experimental status of B0-B0bar oscillations, the LHCb measurement of deltam in Bd2JpsiKstar and Bd2Dpi.
\end{itemize}

\section{Charge-Parity violation in the SM}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Discrete symmetries, CPT, weak and strong phases, CPV observables, classification of CPV, CP eigenstates
  \item CPV in SM: gauge symmetries, fermions in the SM, CKM matrix, the unitarity triangle, CKM parametrization
\end{itemize}
\subsection{CP violation in the decay Bd2JpsiKS}
\begin{itemize}
  \item CPV in this unique decay, master formulas, etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Decay-time dependent measurement of sin2beta}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Description of the measurement technique: decay-time dependence, flavour tagging
