{\CPbfsf violation in the \Bdbfsf meson system}
\label{ch:cpv_theory}

In this chapter the theoretical background helpful to the understanding of the
work described in this thesis is outlined. Starting with the \acl*{SM} the
theoretical framework constructed to explain the observed phenomenology of
fundamental particles and their interactions is described. Then an overview off
the field of flavour physics is given, including the baseline ideas of quark
mixing and \CP violation in the \Bmeson system, as well as the master equations
utilised in the measurement of \CP violation in the decay of \BdToJpsiKS.
