{\CPbfsf violation in the \Bdbfsf meson system}
\label{ch:cpv_theory}

In this chapter the theoretical background of \CP violation in the \Bd meson
system is outlined. Starting with the \acl*{SM} the theoretical framework
constructed to explain the observed phenomenology of fundamental particles and
their interactions is described. Then an overview off the field of flavour
physics is given, including the baseline ideas of quark mixing and \CP violation
in the \Bmeson system, as well as the \emph{master equations} utilised in the
measurement of \CP violation in the decay channel \BdToJpsiKS.
