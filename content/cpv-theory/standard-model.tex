\section{The \acl*{SM}}
\label{sec:cpv_theory:standard_model}

The \acf{SM} describes the constituents of matter and the fundamental forces.
The theoretical model is rigorously tested by experiments and up to date any
attempts to falsify even a part of it were unsuccessful. From the beginning of
the 1960s until the discovery of the Higgs boson \cite{Aad:2015zhl} all
experimental evidence found, is in support of the \SM. Nevertheless, the \SM
must be part of some bigger universal theory. The absence of a suitable dark
matter candidate, a missing predictive model explaining the quark and lepton
mass hierarchy and mixing, and the lack of an explanation of the Higgs hierarchy
problem, are just a selection of questions that are not answered by the \SM.
