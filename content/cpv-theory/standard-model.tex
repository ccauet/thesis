\section{The \acl*{SM}}
\label{sec:cpv_theory:standard_model}

The \acf{SM} describes the constituents of matter and the fundamental forces.
The theoretical model has been rigorously tested by experiments and any attempts
to falsify even a part of it have been unsuccessful up to date. From the
beginning of the 1960s until the discovery of the Higgs boson \cite{Aad:2015zhl}
all experimental evidence found had been in support of the \SM. Nevertheless,
the \SM must be part of some bigger universal theory: The absence of a suitable
dark matter candidate, a missing predictive model explaining the quark and
lepton mass hierarchy and mixing, and the absence of anti-matter/the abundance
of matter in the visible universe, are just a selection of questions that are
not answered by the \SM.

The theoretical framework of the \SM is built as a quantum field theory
describing the dynamics and kinematics of the theory. Based on the gauge group
$\group{SU}{3}\otimes\group{SU}{2}\otimes\group{U}{1}$ the \SM Lagrangian
$\mathcal{L}_{\text{\acs*{SM}}}$ describes all\footnote{The \ac{SM} does not
describes gravity, which makes in not less attractive from the perspective of
high energy particle physics.} known fundamental forces and their bosonic force
mediators, the fermionic particles forming matter, as well as the scalar field
that lends masses to the bosons and fermions of the \SM through the mechanism of
spontaneous symmetry breaking.

The fermionic fields can be expressed by their left-handed doublets of quarks

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:cpv_theory:standard_model:quarks}

    \uquark \\
    \dquark^\prime

    \cquark \\
    \squark^\prime
  \end{pmatrix}_{\text{L}}\eqspace
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \tquark \\
    \bquark^\prime
  \end{pmatrix}_{\text{L}}

and leptons

  \begin{pmatrix}
    \nutau \\

as well as their right-handed singlet counterparts

The \SM does not include right-handed neutrinos, yet they might be necessary to
explain the observed non-vanishing neutrino masses. To each listed particle, an
anti-particle with opposite signed charge quantum numbers exist, usually denoted
with an overbar, \eg $\quarkbar$.

The fundamental interactions are represented by the \EM force, the weak force,
and the strong force. The \EM and weak interactions can be unified in the so
called electro-weak interaction \cite{set:gws}, represented by an
$\group{SU}{2}\otimes\group{U}{1}$ gauge group. Four corresponding massless
gauge bosons are present that can be associated with the $\group{SU}{2}$ and
$\group{U}{1}$ group. After the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry at the
electro-weak energy scale the massless photon $\photon$ and the massive $\Wpm$
and $\Zboson$ bosons emerge.

The photon couples to particles with non-zero \EM charge, \ie the charged
leptons $\electron$, $\muon$, and $\tauon$ and the quarks. The likewise
uncharged \Zboson additionally couples to the uncharged neutrinos. The bosons
$\Wpm$ act as mediators between the upper and lower parts of the fermionic
doublets enabling \eg the radioactive $\beta$ decay with a
$\dquark\to\uquark\electron\nuelbar$ transition through the exchange of a $\Wm$.

Finally, the strong force couples to the colour charge carried solely by quarks
and is mediated by gluons. Quarks cannot be observed in unbound states, thus
always form composite particles (\emph{hadrons}) as \eg the proton consists of
two $\uquark$-quarks and one $\dquark$-quark. In general, particles composed of
three quarks ($\quark\quark\quark$) or three anti-quarks
($\quarkbar\quarkbar\quarkbar$) are called \emph{baryons}, particles with a
quark and an anti-quark as constituents ($\quark\quarkbar$) are called
\emph{mesons}.

All visible matter consists entirely of first generation quarks ($\uquark$ and
$\dquark$) and leptons ($\electron$), thus no other particles are mandatory to
explain most physical phenomena and moreover it seems non-essential that they
exist at all. To shed light into this puzzle the structure and hierarchy of the
quark and lepton sector is studied in the field of \emph{flavour physics}.
