\chapter{Introduction \& Motivation}
Start with a first short introduction of the SM, B physics phenomenology, shortly introducing CPV, and sin2beta

\section{The Standard Model of particle physics}
SM of particle physics: leptons, quarks, gauge bosons, higgs, forces, mathematical concepts, shortcomings 

\section{The Large Hadron Collider}
The purpose of the LHC collider, technical specs, ATLAS, CMS, ALICE

\section{The LHC beauty experiment}
General overview of the detector: physics case, (collaboration,) design, advantages over ATLAS, CMS, ALICE; 

physics motivation:
heavy flavour physics, indirect searches/evidence, BSM, CP violation, rare decays, beauty and charm hadrons, fully consistent with the SM and CKM, matter-antimatter asymmetry, new source of CPV beyond the SM needed

\section{The measurement of sin2beta}
General idea of the measurement and the key concepts
