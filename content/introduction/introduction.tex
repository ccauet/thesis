\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

The visible universe shows a maximal asymmetry between matter and anti-matter
with complete absence of anti-matter (by definition) except in cosmic rays. With
the big bang theory being established a source of the asymmetry needs to be
determined. A possible explanation was provided by Sakharov
\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}. To achieve a universal baryon asymmetry three conditions
have to be fulfilled: 1) baryon number violating processes, 2) the violation of
\CSym and \CP in fundamental interactions, and 3) a deviation from the thermal
equilibrium during in the history of the universe.

The non-equilibrium state is guaranteed due to the expansion of the universe and
baryon number violation processes are known as well
\cite{tHooft:1976up,Rubakov:1996vz}, thus leaving us to find a source of \CP
violation large enough to explain the existing matter-antimatter asymmetry.

Discrete global symmetries play an outstanding role in the \SM. In particular,
the charge conjugation $\CSym$, the parity $\PSym$, and the time reversal
$\TSym$ transformations. The \CPT theorem \cite{set:cpt} states that the \CPT
symmetry holds for a quantum field theory, whereas the violation of each of
the discrete symmetries $\CSym$, $\PSym$, or $\TSym$ is still possible.

Lee and Yang where the first to question the general assumption of this time that all
physical interactions are invariant even under a single transformation by
stating a possible $\PSym$ violation in weak interactions \cite{Lee:1956qn}. This
statement was backed soon after by the measurement of $\PSym$ violation in the
$\beta^{-}$ decay of \cobaltsixty \cite{Wu:1957my}. The experiment
revealed that the weak interaction only couples to fermions with left-handed
chirality or anti-fermions with right-handed chirality, thus also violating
symmetry under the $\CSym$ transformation. Still, the interaction seems to behave
invariant under combined $\CP$ transformations. Not until 1964 the symmetry
violation under $\CP$ transformation was observed in the neutral kaon system
\cite{Christenson:1964fg} and consequently established in the \SM.

Writing the source of \CP violation into the \SM still was a challenge. The
triumphant idea came from Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa
\cite{Kobayashi:1973fv} proposing a third quark generation as a possibility to
explain \CP violation in the framework of the electroweak theory. Four years
later the discovery of the \bquark quark \cite{Herb:1977ek} provided enough
confidence in their theory to start planning the two \BFactories \Babar and
\Belle. At the two $\elel$ colliders PEP-II (Stanford, CA, US) and KEKB
(Tsukuba, JP) electrons and positrons were brought to collisions at asymmetric
energies. Both machines operated at a centre-of-mass energy of exactly the
\YFourS bottonium resonance at $\SI{10.58}{\GeV}$, producing $\B\Bbar$ meson
pairs at high rates of $\num{e6}$ a day, therefore their nomenclature
\cite{Bevan:2014iga}.

To definitely establishing \CP violation in the \SM it was necessary to extend
the measurements outside the kaon sector to the heavier \B and \D meson systems.
Predominantly built to study \CP violation in the \Bmeson system, \Babar and
\Belle were soon be successful and reported the observation of \CP violation in
decays of \Bd mesons to charmonium final states in 2001
\cite{Aubert:2001nu,Abe:2001xe}.

The \enquote{golden observable} \cite{Bevan:2014iga} of \CP violation in the \Bd
meson system is the decay-time dependent \CP asymmetry between the  \BdToJpsiKS
and \BdbarToJpsiKS decays
%
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:cpv_theory:bd2jpsiks:cp_asymmetry}
    \CPAsymmetry(\obsTime) \equiv 
      \frac{\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) - \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)}
           {\Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bdbar(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr) + \Gamma\bigl(\decay{\Bd(\obsTime)}{\Jpsi\KS}\bigr)} \eqcm
\end{equation*}
%
that can directly be set in relation with the angle $\beta$ of the \CKM quark
mixing matrix as the source of \CP violation in the \SM. In recent years the
value of \sintwobeta was measured to a precision of below $\SI{3}{\percent}$
with an world average of $\sintwobeta = \num{0.682 +- 0.019}$, dominated by the
measurements of \Babar and \Belle \cite{Amhis:2014hma}. Taking into account
measurements of other parameters that constrain the value of \sintwobeta to
$0.711\pm^{0.017}_{0.041}$ \cite{Charles:2015gya} a small discrepancy with
respect to the direct measurement is observed.

The insignificant but visible tension is leading to the principal idea of
precision measurements of \CKM parameters. Although all conditions presented by
Sakharov are met in the \SM the strength of \CP violation is not large enough to
sufficiently explain the baryon asymmetry. Consequently, the source of the \CP
violation has to be located in physics beyond the \SM. One way to cope with
this, is the direct search for new particles at higher mass scales, apparently
not very successful until now. The more delicate way is to help oneself with
indirect searches. Quantum loop processes may contain contributions from heavy
particles even if they take place at far lower energies than necessary to
produce them directly, thus allowing to get a peek of physics scales far above
the current experimental limits. Therefore, together with precise theory
predictions, possible deviations from the \SM can appear in precision
measurements of \SM parameters.

To met the high demands defined by a precision measurement the experimental
setup has to be customised to the physics case. In case of decay-time dependent
measurements the spatial and time resolution has to be excellent to resolve
production and decay vertices. This allows for an efficient and precise
reconstruction of particle trajectories and decays. Additionally the \PID has to
be very efficient with low mis-identification rates in order to correctly
identify final state particles.

The \LHCb detector located at the \LHC at the \CERN was designed with these
requirements in mind and operates very successfully since 2009. The \LHCb
experiment aims to study heavy flavour physics by exploiting direct and indirect
experimental techniques to its full extent. Its physics program includes \CP
violation measurements in $\B$ and $\D$ meson decays
\cite{Aaij:2015tza,Aaij:2015yda,Aaij:2014uva,Aaij:2014fba,Aaij:2014dka,Aaij:2014zsa,Aaij:2014kxa}, 
the search for (very) rare decays \cite{CMS:2014xfa}, tests of
lepton-universality \cite{Aaij:2014ora,Aaij:2015yra}, as well as heavy flavour
spectroscopy \cite{Aaij:2014yka,Aaij:2015tga}.

\subsubsection*{Outline}

In \cref{ch:cpv_theory} the \SM is shortly recapped with an emphasis on flavour
physics and \CP violation in the quark sector. The nature of Yukawa
interactions and the appearance of the \CKM matrix through spontaneous symmetry
breaking are summarised. Then, the time evolution of \Bmesons including decay
and flavour oscillations is outlined. Finally, an overview of the measurement of
\CP violation in the decay of \BdToJpsiKS is given.

The \LHCb detector and its subsystems are briefly described in
\cref{ch:lhcb_experiment} with particular attention to the track reconstruction
and \acl{PID} techniques. The \LHCb trigger system is sketched and the software
stack is depicted. At this point, the data taking in the first successful years
of running is summarised also.

As it plays an important role in this analysis the flavour tagging algorithms
utilised at \LHCb are discussed in more detail in \cref{ch:flavour_tagging}.
After a general overview and a comparison to developments at the \BFactories the
flavour tagging algorithms are explained. Afterwards, the calibration of the
flavour tagging output is motivated and described. The performance of the
methods is then described and an outlook on recent developments is given.

The main part (\cref{ch:measurement_of_sin2beta}) contains the details of the
performed measurement. The data taking and preparation is explained as well as
studies of potential background contributions. The influence of decay time
acceptance and resolution effects is briefly summarised. Before the results are
presented the likelihood function is presented. Finally, all studies of
systematic effects are collected.

This thesis concludes with a summary and puts the results in context to the
global \CKM picture. Furthermore, \RunTwo and \LHCb upgrade prospects are
presented.
