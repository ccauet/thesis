\chapter{Intro}
Start with a first short introduction of the SM, B physics phenomenology, shortly introducing CPV, and sin2beta

\section{SM}
SM of particle physics: leptons, quarks, gauge bosons, higgs, forces, mathematical concepts, shortcomings 

\section{LHC}
The purpose of the LHC collider, technical specs, ATLAS, CMS, ALICE

\section{LHCb}
General overview of the detector: physics case, (collaboration,) design, advantages over ATLAS, CMS, ALICE; 

\section{B physics and CPV}
Roundup of B physics: observation of b quarks, B oscillations, CKM, CPV

\section{sin2beta}
General idea of the measurement and the key concepts
