\section{Flavour tagging}
\label{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:flavour_tagging}

The flavour tagging employed is described in detail in
\cref{ch:flavour_tagging}. Two different tagging decisions are utilised: the
\acf{OS} tagger combination and the \acf{SSpi} tagger. The calibration and
subsequent combination of the two tagging decisions is performed within the fit
(\cf \cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:likelihood_fit}). To assure correct
propagation of uncertainties and correlations of the calibration parameters to
the \CP parameters Gaussian constraints based on the calibration parameters'
central values and theirs statistical uncertainties are applied. The influence
of the systematic uncertainties on the calibration parameters is described in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:systematics:systematics}.
