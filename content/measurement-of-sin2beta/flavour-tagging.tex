\section{Flavour tagging}
\label{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:flavour_tagging}

The flavour tagging employed in the analysis recorded at the \LHCb experiment is
described in detail in \cref{ch:flavour_tagging}.

Two different tagging decisions are utilised: the \acf{OS} tagger combination
and the \acf{SSpi} tagger. The calibration and subsequent combination of the two
tagging decisions is performed within the fit (\cf
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:likelihood_fit}) to assure correct propagation
of uncertainties and correlations of the calibration parameters to the \CP
parameters by applying Gaussian constraints based on the calibration parameters'
central values and theirs statistical uncertainties. The influence of the
systematic uncertainties on the calibration parameters is described in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:systematics:systematics}.
