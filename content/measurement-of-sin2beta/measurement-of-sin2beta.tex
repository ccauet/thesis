\section{Overview of the measurement ingredients}
\label{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:overview}

The measurement of \CP violation in the decay of \BdToJpsiKS poses a variety of
challenges to the experimenter. Great demands on the vertex resolution, the
decay time resolution, \PID, and the trigger have to be fulfilled by the \LHCb
detector as was outlined in \cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:detector}.

In the analysis an emphasis has to be placed especially on the identification of
the initial \Bmeson flavour, the so called flavour tagging, that is explained in
more detail in \cref{ch:flavour_tagging}.

This chapter now summarises the measurement of the \CP parameters \SJpsiKS and
\CJpsiKS itself. Starting with an overview of the data in use, including data
taking, trigger strategy, candidate selection and employment of simulated data
(\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:data_preparation}) a short round-up of the
flavour tagging is provided (\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:flavour_tagging}). 

Possible troublesome influences from mis-reconstructed or mis-identified
physical background contributions are studied in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:physic_backgrounds}. The decay time resolution
model and how to handle the estimate on the decay time resolution from the \DTF
are described in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:resolution_and_acceptance} together with
the parametrisation of the decay time acceptance caused by reconstruction and
selection inefficiencies. The utilised likelihood function is presented in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:likelihood_fit} before showing the results of
the fit in \cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:cpv_measurement}. Finally, all
studies on the systematic influences of a variety of effects are collected in
\cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:systematics}.
