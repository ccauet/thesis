\missing{General idea of the measurement and the key concepts}

The measurement of \CP violation in the decay of \BdToJpsiKS poses a variety of
challenges to the experimenter. Great demands on the vertex resolution, the
decay time resolution, \PID, and the trigger have to be fulfilled by the \LHCb
detector as was outlined in \cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:detector}.

In the analysis an emphasis has to be placed especially on the identification of
the initial \Bmeson flavour, the so called flavour tagging, that will be
explained in more detail in \cref{ch:flavour_tagging}. 

technical ingredients:
flavour tagging
physic backgrounds
decay time resolution
acceptance
systematic effects
