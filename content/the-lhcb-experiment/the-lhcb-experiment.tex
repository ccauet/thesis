\section{The \acs*{LHC}, \acl*{pp} interactions, and $\bquark$ hadron production}
\label{ch:lhcb_experiment:lhc}

With a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\kilo\metre} the \LHC is the largest man-made
particle accelerator. Using a \enquote{two-in-one} super-conducting magnet
design, two counter-rotating beams of protons (or ions) are intersected and
brought to collision at four interaction points, home of the large \LHC
experiments \acs*{ALICE}, \acs*{ATLAS}, \acs*{CMS}, and \acs*{LHCb}. The
colliders centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{14}{\TeV}$ and a peak
luminosity of $L=\SI{10e34}{\lumi}$ provide \LHC's experiments with high event
rates that are necessary in their searches for physics beyond the \SM.

Following approval in 1994, the \LHC re-used the existing \LEP tunnel and most
of its infrastructure after \LEP shut down in 2000. The \LHC---and former
\LEP---tunnel is built up of eight straight and eight arc sections and has a
internal diameter of $\SI{3.7}{\metre}$. It is located north-west of Geneva,
Switzerland at a depth between $\SI{45}{\metre}$ and $\SI{170}{\metre}$ below
the surface. The storage ring consists of superconducting NbTi magnets kept at
an operating temperature of $\SI{1.9}{\kelvin}$ by superfluid helium. A
superconducting \RF cavity system captures, accelerates, and stores the two
proton beams.

At design luminosity $\num{2808}$ bunches with a bunch spacing of
$\SI{25}{\nano\metre}$ are stored in each proton beam. The \LHC relies on a
supply chain of smaller accelerators providing the initial proton bunches.
\Cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:lhc:cern_accelerator_complex} depicts the \acs{CERN}
accelerator complex. A bottle of hydrogen gas is the source of the protons, that
are then subsequently accelerated to higher energies by the \LINACTwo, the
\BOOSTER, the \PSyn, and the \SPS, before being injected into the \LHC at an
energy of $\SI{450}{\GeV}$. The transfer lines Tl2 and Tl8 are used to inject
the protons bunches in both beam directions. As soon as the nominal number of
proton bunches is reached, the beam energies are increased up to $\SI{7}{\TeV}$
for each beam. The average \LHC turnaround time, \ie the time it takes to run
through the whole accelerator chain until a stable beam is achieved, adds up to
seven hours. Mainly due to beam loss from \pp collisions the beam intensities
and the instantaneous luminosity decays. Starting from a peak luminosity of
$L=\SI{10e34}{\lumi}$ a luminosity lifetime of 15 hours is estimated. To prevent
uncontrolled beam losses and to protect the \LHC infrastructure and the \LHC
experiments a beam dump system is installed. The fully automated system monitors
the beam condition and is able to extract the beam from the \LHC using kicker
magnets in case of a failure. The beam dump system is also used regularly to
extract the beam after a successful run.

  Starting from the \acs{LINACTwo}, protons are accelerated through the
  \acs{BOOSTER}, the \acs{PSyn} and finally the \acs{SPS} before being injected
  into the \LHC. If one or both beams consist of heavy ions, the
  \acs{LINACThree} and the \acs{LEIR} are used to accelerate the ions and inject
  them into the \acs{PSyn}.

Shortly after the first successful circulation of two proton beams in September
2008, a fault occurred in the electrical bus connection between two magnets,
leading to a large helium leak and serious damage to several of \LHC's magnets
and infrastructure. After the incident, the management decided to reduce the
beam energy and intensity. Thus, in the years 2010 and 2011 the \LHC centre-of-
mass energy was $\sqrt{s}=\SI{7}{\TeV}$ with a bunch spacing of
$\SI{50}{\nano\metre}$ delivering a peak instantaneous luminosity of
$\SI{2.4e33}{\lumi}$. An increase of the beam energy to $\sqrt{s}=\SI{8}{\TeV}$
lead to a peak instantaneous luminosity of $\SI{7.7e33}{\lumi}$ in 2012
\cite{Lamont:2013cma}.

The \LHC is not only capable of colliding protons but also lead ions in Pb$-$Pb
as well as in $p-$Pb and Pb$-p$ collisions. For this purpose the \ALICE detector
\cite{Aamodt:2008zz} is specifically designed to study QCD interactions and the
quark-gluon plasma produced in the \LHC ion runs, where it has to cope with very
large particle multiplicities. In the case of an heavy ion run, the \LINACThree
and the \LEIR mark the starting point of the accelerator chain, before injecting
the lead ions into the \PSyn. 

In total seven experiments are located at the four interaction regions of the
\LHC. The two multi-purpose detectors \ATLAS \cite{Aad:2008zzm} and \CMS
\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa} are installed at opposite sides of the storage ring.
Both experiments cover a great variety of physics activities: the search for
scalar particles, particles predicted by super-symmetric models, dark matter
candidates, and evidence of extra spacial dimensions. Around the interaction
regions of the \CMS experiment, the \TOTEM detectors \cite{Anelli:2008zza} are
located. Together with the \LHCf experiment \cite{Adriani:2008zz}, located on
both sides of the \ATLAS interaction region, the detectors are designated to
study in the \enquote{forward} region of the collisions at very small angles to
the beam direction.
