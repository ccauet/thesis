\section{The LHC, proton-proton interactions, and $\bquark$ hadron production}
\label{ch:lhcb_experiment:lhc}

With a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\kilo\metre} the \LHC is the largest man-made
particle accelerator. Using a \enquote{two-in-one} super-conducting magnet
design, two counter-rotating beams of protons (or ions) are intersected and
brought to collision at four interaction points, home of the large \LHC
experiments \acs*{ALICE}, \acs*{ATLAS}, \acs*{CMS}, and \acs*{LHCb}. The
colliders centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{14}{\TeV}$ and a peak
luminosity of $L=\SI{10e34}{\lumi}$ provides \LHC's experiments with high event
rates that are necessary in their searches for physics beyond the \SM.

Following approval in 1994, the \LHC re-used the existing \LEP tunnel and most
of its infrastructure after \LEP shut down in 2000. The \LHC--and former \LEP--
tunnel is built up of eight straight and eight arc sections and has a internal
diameter of $\SI{3.7}{\metre}$. The storage ring consists of $\num{1232}$
$\SI{15}{\metre}$ long dipole magnets, each able to create a magnetic field of
$\SI{8}{\tesla}$ and build out of superconducting NbTi kept at an operating
temperature of $\SI{1.9}{\kelvin}$ using superfluid helium. Quadrupole magnets
are utilized to focus the beams, while several types of quadrupole, sextupole,
and octupole correction magnets stabilise the beam.

\section{Particle identification}
\subsection{RICH}
\begin{itemize}
  \item general: cherenkov light detectors, spherical and flat mirrors, hybrid photon detectors
  \item RICH1: low momentum charged particles, 1-60GeV/c, aerogel and C4F10 radiators

\section{Trigger}
two level trigger system: L0 and HLT, L0 from custom made electronics, real-time with bunch crossing-frequency, HLT on software in processor farm
\subsection{L0 trigger}
from 40MHz to 1MHz, trigger on large transverse momentum pT and energy ET; the hightest ET hadron, electron, photon clusters in the calo; the two highest pT muons in the muon chambers; pile-up system in velo calculates the number of PVs; the caos calculate the total observed energy and estimate the number of tracks based on the number of hits in the SPD; using these global event cuts to reject events which would otherwise be triggered due to large combinatorics
\subsection{High level trigger}
reduced the 1MHz L0 output rate to 5kHz; software based and flexible, again composed of two parts: HLT1 and HLT2;
