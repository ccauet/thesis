\section{The \acs*{LHC} and its experiments}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:lhc}

With a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\kilo\metre} the \LHC is the largest man-made
particle accelerator. Using a \enquote{two-in-one} super-conducting magnet
design, two counter-rotating beams of protons (or ions) are intersected and
brought to collision at four interaction points, home of the large \LHC
experiments \acs*{ALICE}, \acs*{ATLAS}, \acs*{CMS}, and \acs*{LHCb}. The
colliders centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{14}{\TeV}$ and a peak
luminosity of $L=\SI{e34}{\lumi}$ provide \LHC's experiments with high event
rates that are necessary in their searches for physics beyond the \SM.

Following approval in 1994, the \LHC re-used the existing \LEP tunnel and most
of its infrastructure after \LEP shut down in 2000. The \LHC---and former
\LEP---tunnel is built up of eight straight and eight arc sections and has a
internal diameter of $\SI{3.7}{\metre}$. It is located north-west of Geneva,
Switzerland at a depth between $\SI{45}{\metre}$ and $\SI{170}{\metre}$ below
the surface. The storage ring consists of superconducting NbTi magnets kept at
an operating temperature of $\SI{1.9}{\kelvin}$ by superfluid helium. A
superconducting \RF cavity system captures, accelerates, and stores the two
proton beams.

At design luminosity, $\num{2808}$ bunches with a bunch spacing of
$\SI{25}{\nano\metre}$ are stored in each proton beam. The \LHC relies on a
supply chain of smaller accelerators providing the initial proton bunches.
\Cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:lhc:cern_accelerator_complex} depicts the \acs{CERN}
accelerator complex. A bottle of hydrogen gas is the source of the protons, that
are then subsequently accelerated to higher energies by the \LINACTwo, the
\BOOSTER, the \PSyn, and the \SPS, before being injected into the \LHC at an
energy of $\SI{450}{\GeV}$. The transfer lines Tl2 and Tl8 are used to inject
the protons bunches in both beam directions. As soon as the nominal number of
proton bunches is reached, the beam energies are increased up to $\SI{7}{\TeV}$
for each beam. The average \LHC turnaround time, \ie the time it takes to run
through the whole accelerator chain until a stable beam is achieved, adds up to
seven hours. Mainly due to beam loss from \pp collisions the beam intensities
and the instantaneous luminosity decays. Starting from a peak luminosity of
$L=\SI{e34}{\lumi}$ a luminosity lifetime of 15 hours is estimated. To prevent
uncontrolled beam losses and to protect the \LHC infrastructure and the \LHC
experiments a beam dump system is installed. The fully automated system monitors
the beam condition and is able to extract the beam from the \LHC using kicker
magnets in case of a failure. The beam dump system is also used regularly to
extract the beam after a successful run. For more information on the \LHC and
resident experiments, see \eg \Ref~\cite{Evans:2008zzb}.

  one or both beams consist of heavy ions, the \acs*{LINACThree} and the
  \acs*{LEIR} are used to accelerate the ions and inject them into the
  \acs{PSyn}. }
  \label{fig:lhcb_experiment:lhc:cern_accelerator_complex}
\end{figure}

Shortly after the first successful circulation of two proton beams in September
2008, a fault occurred in the electrical bus connection between two magnets,
leading to a large helium leak and serious damage to several of \LHC's magnets
and infrastructure. After the incident, the management decided to reduce the
beam energy and intensity. Thus, in the years 2010 and 2011 the \LHC
centre-of-mass energy was $\sqrt{s}=\SI{7}{\TeV}$ with a bunch spacing of
$\SI{50}{\nano\metre}$ delivering a peak instantaneous luminosity of
$\SI{2.4e33}{\lumi}$. An increase of the beam energy to $\sqrt{s}=\SI{8}{\TeV}$
lead to a peak instantaneous luminosity of $\SI{7.7e33}{\lumi}$ in 2012
\cite{Lamont:2013cma}.

The \LHC is not only capable of colliding protons but also lead ions in Pb-Pb as
well as in \proton-Pb and Pb-\proton collisions. For this purpose the
\acs{ALICE} (\acl{ALICE}) detector \cite{Aamodt:2008zz} is specifically designed
to study QCD interactions and the quark-gluon plasma produced in the \LHC ion
runs, where it has to cope with very large particle multiplicities. In the case
of an heavy ion run, the
\LINACThree and the \LEIR mark the starting point of the accelerator chain,
before injecting the lead ions into the \PSyn.

In total, seven experiments are located at the four interaction regions of the
\LHC. The two multi-purpose detectors \acs{ATLAS} (\acl{ATLAS})
\cite{Aad:2008zzm} and \acs{CMS} (\acl{CMS}) \cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa} are
installed at opposite sides of the storage ring. Both experiments cover a great
variety of physics activities: the search for scalar particles, particles
predicted by super-symmetric models, dark matter candidates, and evidence for
extra spacial dimensions. Around the interaction regions of the \CMS experiment,
the \acs{TOTEM} (\acl{TOTEM}) detectors \cite{Anelli:2008zza} are located.
Together with the \LHCf experiment \cite{Adriani:2008zz}, located on both sides
of the \ATLAS interaction region, the detectors are designated to address the
study of the \enquote{forward} region of the collisions at very small angles to
the beam direction. The seventh experiment \acs{MoEDAL} (\acl{MoEDAL}) extends
the \LHC physics program to the direct search for magnetic monopoles. Still
missing in this list, is the \LHCb experiment, that will be explained in more
detail in the next section.

\section{The LHCb detector}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:detector}

The \LHCb detector is a unique precision instrument solely designed to study \CP
violation and rare decays of beauty and charm hadrons. It is constructed as a
single-arm spectrometer covering an angular range from approximately
$\SI{10}{\mrad}$ to $\SI{300}{\mrad}$ ($\SI{250}{\mrad}$) in the
horizontal (vertical) plane.

The detector layout exploits the characteristics of the heavy flavour production
in \protonproton collisions at the \LHC. The production of heavy quarks in an
hadronic environment is dominated by quark pair production in gluon-gluon fusion
$\gluon\gluon\to\bbbar/\ccbar$ and quark-antiquark annihilation
$\qqbar\to\bbbar/\ccbar$.

The heavy quark production cross-sections depend on the centre-of-mass energy
$\sqrt{s}$ of the \protonproton collision. As illustrated in
\cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:detector:cross_section} the $\bbbar$ pair
cross-section behaves approximately linearly with $\sqrt{s}$ and lies roughly in
the order of $\SI{300}{\microbarn}$ for $\sqrt{s}=\SI{7}{\TeV}$.
%
\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{private/content/the-lhcb-experiment/figs/lhc_cross_sections.pdf}
  \caption{
    Production cross-sections as a function of the \acl{protonproton} collision centre-of-mass energy. \cite{Campbell:2006wx}
  }
  \label{fig:lhcb_experiment:detector:cross_section}
\end{figure}
%
At \LHC energies the partons involved in the collisions are likely to carry very
different momenta, leading to a strong boost of the produced quark pair in
direction of the beam axis. Thus, the produced quarks have a high probability of
being produced at a small azimuthal angle $\theta_{1,2}$ with respect to the
beam axis. \Cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:detector:production} illustrates the the
correlation of the two quark angles $\theta_{1}$ and $\theta_{2}$. The red
shaded region marks the \LHCb detector acceptance where around
$\SI{25}{\percent}$ of all produced $\bbbar$ quark pairs are found.

The acceptance is depicted as well in
\cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:detector:production} as a function of the quark
\acl{pseudorapidity} $\text{\acs{pseudorapidity}} = -\ln(\tan(\theta/2))$. Here
the \LHCb acceptance region ($\num{1.8} < \eta < \num{4.9}$) can be identified
by the red rectangle while the acceptance of the \acfp{GPD} \ATLAS and \CMS is
marked by the yellow rectangle.

  (Left) The red shaded region or (right) the red rectangle mark the \LHCb
  detector acceptance.}
  \label{fig:lhcb_experiment:detector:production}
\end{figure}
%

After production each $\bquark$ quark hadronises independently forming a
\bhadron. Most likely by bounding to a light quark forming a $\Bu$ or a $\Bd$
(\SI{40}{\percent} each), to heavier quarks as in $\Bs$ (\SI{11}{\percent}) or
even $\bquark$ baryons as $\Lambdab$ (\SI{9}{\percent}). The numbers in
parenthesis denote the fraction of the total production in percent
\cite{Agashe:2014kda}.

At his point, flavour conjugate states are implied as the production is in
principle symmetric in quark flavour. However, as the \protonproton collision
defines an initial state with positive charge and in absence of any
anti-valence-quarks, different production rates are expected
\cite{Chaichian:1993rh,Norrbin:2000zc,Norrbin:2000jy}. As this influences the
flavour-sensitive \CP violation measurement, precautions are taken as described
in \cref{sec:measurement_of_sin2beta:likelihood_fit:model:decay_time}.

\section{Track reconstruction}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking}

The \LHCb track reconstruction is based on information from a set of tracking
detectors: the \VELO, the \TT, the \IT and the \OT. Silicon microstrips are used
in the first three, while the latter is constructed as a drift-time detector.
The \VELO is described in \cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:velo}, the \TT and
the \IT in \cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:ttit}, and the \OT in
\cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:ot}.
\important{The magnet is missing!}

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The \acl*{VELO}}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:velo}

Surrounding the \protonproton interaction region the \VELO's main purpose is the
precise position measurement of traversing particles to reconstruct the \ac{PV}
and displaced \acp{SV}. To achieve the best possible spatial resolution the
sensors must be positioned close to the beam trajectory. To allow the sensors to
be as close as $\SI{8}{\milli\metre}$ to the interaction region and still
prevent damage during beam injection, the \VELO modules are split in two halves
and can be retracted until stable beams are present. Each single module consists
of two half-disk shaped silicon microstrip sensor modules covering either the
radial dimensions ($R$ sensor) or the angular dimension ($\Phi$ sensor) as can
be seen in the schematic visualisation in
\cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:tracking:velo:sensor}.
%
\begin{figure}[t]

  \label{fig:lhcb_experiment:tracking:velo:sensor}

The \VELO covers the total \LHCb acceptance region, such that all tracks cross
at least three \VELO stations. \Cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:tracking:velo:overview}

\subsection{The \acs*{LHCb} tracking system}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:ttit}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:tracking:ot}

The \TT as well as the \IT make use of silicon microstrip sensors to track
particle trajectories. The planar \TT station is located upstream of the magnet
and is $\SI{150}{\centi\metre}$ wide and $\SI{130}{\centi\metre}$ high. The
three \IT stations are on the downstream side of the magnet and cover a central
region around the beam pipe that is $\SI{120}{\centi\metre}$ wide and
$\SI{40}{\centi\metre}$ high. Each of the stations has four detector layers,
where the strips in the two inner layer are rotated $\pm\SI{5}{\degree}$ to
allow for two dimensional positioning.

The outer region of the three downstream tracking stations, called \OT, consists
of a drift-time detector constructed from an array of gas-filled straw-tube
modules. The large planar detector spans an active area of $\SI[product-units =
power]{6 x 5}{\metre}$. With drift times smaller than $\SI{50}{\nano\second}$
and a drift-coordinate resolution of $\SI{20}{\micro\metre}$ the \OT allows for
tracking in the low occupancy region around the \IT.

\section{Particle identification}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid}

The \LHCb \PID system consists of two \acp{RICH}, up- and downstream of the
magnet, the calorimeter system, and the muon system. Based on the information
from the \PID systems a likelihood for a given particle hypothesis is
determined. The \acp{RICH} are further described in
\cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:rich}, the calorimeter system in
\cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:calo}, and the muon system in
\cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:muon}.

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The \aclp*{RICH}}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:rich}

Exploiting the radiation emitted by a charged particle moving through a medium
at a speed greater than the speed of light, the two \acp{RICH} are used to
distinguish between pions, kaons, and protons. As illustrated in
\cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:tracking:pid:radiator} the cherenkov angle
$\Theta_\mathrm{C}$ shows a strong momentum dependence and therefore different
radiators are used to get a particle hypothesis for low- and high-momentum
particles. The detectors make use of a system of flat and spherical mirrors to
reflect the emitted light to \acp{HPD}.

\RICH1 is located upstream of the magnet in between the \VELO and the \TT,
contains aerogel and \fluorocarbonfour gas radiators, and provides \PID for
particles with low momenta from $\SIrange[range-phrase = \text{ to },range-units
= single]{1}{60}{\GeVc}$. \RICH2 is located after the last tracking station,
uses \fluorocarbon gas as a radiator and allows \PID for particles in the range
from $\SIrange[range-phrase = \text{ to },range-units =
single]{15}{\geq100}{\GeVc}$.

  \fluorocarbonfour radiator only \cite{Adinolfi:2012qfa}.}
  \label{fig:lhcb_experiment:tracking:pid:radiator}
\end{figure}

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The calorimeter system}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:calo}

The \LHCb calorimeter system is used for both trigger and \PID. It consists of
an \ECAL---including the \SPD and the \PS---followed by a \HCAL. All the
calorimeter sub-systems make use of the scintillation light originating from
traversing charged particles that is collected and transmitted by fibres to
\acp{PMT}.

First, the \SPD selects charged particles, secondly the \PS provides separation
of charged pions and electrons. Finally the \ECAL measures the energy deposition
and position of electromagnetic showers. The \HCAL is a massive
$\SI[product-units = power]{8.4 x 6.8}{\metre}$ planar, $\SI{500}{\tonne}$
detector, build-up from alternating iron plates and scintillating tiles,
providing energy measurements of hadronic showers.

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The muon system}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:pid:muon}

The muon system consists of five stations of \MWPC, provides muon \PID and
serves as a high \pT trigger. The system is located in front of (M1) and behind
(M2-M5) the calorimeter system. It is especially important for charmonium final
states, as $\BdToJpsiKS$ considered in the analysis described in this thesis.

\section{Trigger}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:trigger}

To cope with up to $\SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ event rate and high particle
multiplicities an efficient online event selection (trigger) system is
necessary. The \LHCb trigger system consists of a \LZero and the \acs{HLT}
(\acl{HLT}) software trigger. The \LZero uses custom made electronics located in
direct proximity of the readout electronics to provide a fast trigger decision
in real-time with the bunch crossing-frequency. The \HLT operates asynchronously
on a processor farm.

\Cref{fig:lhcb_experiment:trigger:overview}\addref{LHCb trigger scheme from speakers bureau} shows an overview of the \LHCb
trigger schematics. The \LZero is described in
\cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:trigger:lzero} while more information on the \HLT can
be found in \cref{sec:lhcb_experiment:trigger:hlt}. Details on the \LHCb trigger
system and its performance during \RunOne can be found in
\Refs~\cite{Aaij:2012me,Albrecht:2013fba}.

%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The \acl*{LZero}}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:trigger:lzero}

The \LZero trigger incorporates information from the \VELO pile-up system, the
calorimeters, and the muon system to provide a decision in under
$\SI{4}{\micro\second}$ after the bunch crossing. This reduces the read-out rate
from the \LHC bunch crossing rate of up to $\SI{40}{\mega\hertz}$ to
$\SI{1}{\mega\hertz}$ at which the full detector can be read out. The \LZero
triggers on the highest \ET calorimeter clusters and the two highest \pT muons
in the muon system. Additionally global event properties as the number of
primary \protonproton interactions estimated by the \VELO pile-up system and the
number of \SPD hits are used to reject events with large combinatorics.

\newpage
%%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The \acl*{HLT}}
\label{sec:lhcb_experiment:trigger:hlt}

To further reduce the data rate the \HLT software trigger handles all events
that pass the \LZero. The \HLT itself is further split into two stages, the
\acs{HLT}1 and the \acs{HLT}2. The first stage performs a partial event
reconstruction using track information from the \VELO, the muon system, and the
main tracking stations to accept events with high \pT tracks. The second \HLT
stage then performs a full event reconstruction on the events passed by the
\acs{HLT}1. Both \HLT stages further reduce the event rate to
$\SIrange[range-units = single, range-phrase = -]{3}{5}{\kilo\hertz}$ before the
data is written to permanent storage.

The \HLT excels in is flexibility and performance, especially regarding the
selection of (di-)muon events. As the \LHC delivers stable physics beams in
about $\SI{30}{\percent}$ of the time, local storage on the computing nodes is
used to \enquote{defer} around $\SI{20}{\percent}$ of the \LZero-passed events
to process them during periods without stable beams \cite{Frank:2014ixa}.
