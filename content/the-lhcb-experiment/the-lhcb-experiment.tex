\section{The LHC, proton-proton interactions, and $\bquark$ hadron production}
\label{ch:lhcb_experiment:lhc}

With a circumference of \SI{26.7}{\kilo\metre} the \LHC is the largest man-made
particle accelerator. Using a \enquote{two-in-one} super-conducting magnet
design, two counter-rotating beams of protons (or ions) are intersected and
brought to collision at four interaction points, home of the large \LHC
experiments \acs*{ALICE}, \acs*{ATLAS}, \acs*{CMS}, and \acs*{LHCb}. The
colliders centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=\SI{14}{\TeV}$ and a peak
luminosity of $L=\SI{10e34}{\lumi}$ provide \LHC's experiments with high event
rates that are necessary in their searches for physics beyond the \SM.

Following approval in 1994, the \LHC re-used the existing \LEP tunnel and most
of its infrastructure after \LEP shut down in 2000. The \LHC---and former
\LEP---tunnel is built up of eight straight and eight arc sections and has a
internal diameter of $\SI{3.7}{\metre}$. It is located north-west of Geneva,
Switzerland at a depth between $\SI{45}{\metre}$ and $\SI{170}{\metre}$ below
the surface. The storage ring consists of superconducting NbTi magnets kept at
an operating temperature of $\SI{1.9}{\kelvin}$ by superfluid helium. A
superconducting \RF cavity system captures, accelerates, and stores the two
proton beams.

At design luminosity $\num{2808}$ bunches with a bunch spacing of
$\SI{25}{\nano\metre}$ are stored in each proton beam. The \LHC relies on a
supply chain of smaller accelerators providing the initial proton bunches.

\section{Track reconstruction}
\subsection{VeLo}
\begin{itemize}
  \item purpose: displaced secondary vertices, decay length, decay time, IP
  \item silicon modules in r and phi, geometrical dimensions, mechanical accuracy, closest approach to beam
  \item acceptance: 1.6 < eta < 4.9; |z| < 10.6cm
  \item requirement of at least three hits in the VELO stations
  \item pile-up veto system
  \item retractable, RF foil, in vacuum (primary and secondary)
  \item hardware interlock system
  \item performance(?)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{TT \& IT}
\begin{itemize}
  \item silicon microstrip sensors
  \item position, geometrical dimensions, active area, x-u-v-x alignment

\begin{itemize}
  \item hits from VELO, TT, IT and OT are combined to form trajectories form the VELO to the calorimeters. 
  \item list different track types: long, upstream, downstream, VELO, T
  \item track seeds, Kalman filter, pattern recognition, ghosts

\section{Particle identification}
\subsection{RICH}
\begin{itemize}
  \item general: cherenkov light detectors, spherical and flat mirrors, hybrid photon detectors
  \item RICH1: low momentum charged particles, 1-60GeV/c, aerogel and C4F10 radiators

  \item HPDs: 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Calo}

\subsection{L0 trigger}
from 40MHz to 1MHz, trigger on large transverse momentum pT and energy ET; the hightest ET hadron, electron, photon clusters in the calo; the two highest pT muons in the muon chambers; pile-up system in velo calculates the number of PVs; the caos calculate the total observed energy and estimate the number of tracks based on the number of hits in the SPD; using these global event cuts to reject events which would otherwise be triggered due to large combinatorics
\subsection{High level trigger}
